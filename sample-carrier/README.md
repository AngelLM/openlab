In this folder you will find the files for a sample carrier. 
Source files can be easily modified to adapt it to your needs. The original model was designed to carry standard samples (76x26x1mm).

Update (13/03/16): Now the number of samples can be easily modified at source files, changing the value of "Number of samples" at Spreadsheet object.
